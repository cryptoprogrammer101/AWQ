    Competition format this year:

Teams will compete in a ten round academic challenge to decide the winner. Each round will consist of ten questions, focused on a global topic based on the study guide provided here. The team that answers the most number of questions correctly will win the competition and have the opportunity to travel to Washington, DC to compete in the national program. There will be an online option for the national competition, if the team is unable to travel to the in-person competition.

In the case of a tie for first place, a head to head tie breaker question will be presented to the teams. This question will focus on a global issue and the team closest to the correct answer will be deemed the winner. For example, a question may be "What is the exact population of China as of January 2020?" In the event of a tie, another question will be asked, until one team is deemed the winner.

    What is Academic WorldQuest?

    Academic WorldQuest is a challenging trivia-style competition that tests students' knowledge of global issues.
    Students form teams, under the guidance of teachers, and prepare by studying materials from the World Affairs Councils of America.
    At the NH competition, teams answer multiple-choice questions. The team with the highest score wins and travels to the National Academic WorldQuest competition in Washington D.C.
