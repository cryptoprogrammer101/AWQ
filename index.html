  What is Academic WorldQuest?

  Academic WorldQuest is a challenging trivia-style competition that tests students' knowledge of global issues.
  Students form teams, under the guidance of teachers, and prepare by studying materials from the World Affairs Councils of America.
  At the NH competition, teams answer multiple-choice questions. The team with the highest score wins and travels to the National Academic WorldQuest competition in Washington D.C.
